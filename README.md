# LinuxSucks
A Collection of memes that I created for r/linuxsucks and r/linuxmemes. These memes can be offensive to Loonixtards, Freetards, FOSS-gandists and Loonix cult members.

Few important terms that we devised between 2022-2023:
* Loonixtards: http://loonixtard.urbanup.com/17770939 
* Linux fanboys: http://linux-fanboy.urbanup.com/15712376
* Freetard: http://freetard.urbanup.com/16037836
* FOSS-gandists: Similar to religious conversion but with fake promises.

Please visit, [r/linuxsucks](https://new.reddit.com/r/linuxsucks/) to see Loonixtard whining in agony.
