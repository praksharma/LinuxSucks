# LinuxSucks
----------------
On 24th March 2025, Reddit decided to [ban me](https://prakhar962.wordpress.com/2025/03/25/i-am-banned-on-reddit-for-promoting-terro-ism/) for sharing content related to terror/*ist activity. Some people never use their braincells. It was a permanent ban and I can't be bothered to use workaround to access Reddit. With this ban, this meme repo comes to an end. The repo will be archived.

RIP, [Captain-Thor](https://www.reddit.com/user/Captain-Thor/) ðŸ«¡

----------------

A Collection of memes that I created for r/linuxsucks, r/linuxsucks101 and r/linuxmemes. These memes can be offensive to Loonixtards, Freetards, FOSS-gandists and Loonix cult members.

Few important terms that we devised around 2022-2023:
* Loonixtards: http://loonixtard.urbanup.com/17770939 
* Linux fanboys: http://linux-fanboy.urbanup.com/15712376
* Freetard: http://freetard.urbanup.com/16037836
* FOSS-gandists: Similar to religious conversion with fake promises.

Please visit, [r/linuxsucks](https://new.reddit.com/r/linuxsucks/) and [r/linuxsucks101](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxsucks101/) to see Loonixtards whining in agony. Unfortunately, r/linuxsucks is constantly brigaded by Loonixtards, we decided to make a new sub r/linuxsucks101, where we have very strict rules and we mostly ban a lot of Loonixtards.

## An old legend
Honorable mention to the [LinuxHaters blogs](https://github.com/atoponce/linuxhaters) and [The Lunduke Journal](https://lunduke.substack.com/) for laying the foundation for the ideas that LinuxSucks is built upon.
