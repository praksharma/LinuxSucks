# LinuxSucks
A Collection of memes that I created for r/linuxsucks, r/linuxsucks101 and r/linuxmemes. These memes can be offensive to Loonixtards, Freetards, FOSS-gandists and Loonix cult members.

Few important terms that we devised around 2022-2023:
* Loonixtards: http://loonixtard.urbanup.com/17770939 
* Linux fanboys: http://linux-fanboy.urbanup.com/15712376
* Freetard: http://freetard.urbanup.com/16037836
* FOSS-gandists: Similar to religious conversion with fake promises.

Please visit, [r/linuxsucks](https://new.reddit.com/r/linuxsucks/) and [r/linuxsucks101](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxsucks101/) to see Loonixtards whining in agony. 

## An old legend
Honorable mention to the [LinuxHaters blogs](https://github.com/atoponce/linuxhaters) and [The Lunduke Journal](https://lunduke.substack.com/) for laying the foundation for the ideas that LinuxSucks is built upon.
